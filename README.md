# Welcome to Dice Roller!
Please enter two integer numbers as arguments:
- The first number will be used as the number of dice.

#### node package api used:
- Used Colors api to turn console error messages red and other outputs to other fun colours. Used on lines 7, 16, 22, 25, 28, 30

#### Problems I ran into:
- Can't decide on an API to add
- Installed yargs then couldn't figure out how to use it then tried to delete it and it still won't work like it did.
- had to check if it's an integer not just a number
