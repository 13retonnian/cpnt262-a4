# Welcome to Dice Roller!
Please enter two integer numbers as arguments:
- The first number will be used as the number of dice.
- The second number will be used as the number of sides on the dice.
- For example (node diceRolle.js 3 6) will be counted as three six sided dice or 3D6.

#### Problems I ran into:
- Can't decide on an API to add
- Installed yargs then couldn't figure out how to use it then tried to delete it and it still won't work like it did.
- had to check if it's an integer not just a number
